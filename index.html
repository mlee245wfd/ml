        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This website is about a person named Maya and her thoughts on things as of 8/23/2021</p>

        <p>This is a picture of my hamster, Mr. Hamster. He is pretty important. My brother came up with his name.</p>
        
        <hr><h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I have lived in Houston my whole life. The elementary school I attended was McDougle. I miss being in elementary school where they give you time to play. 
            The time I had to go to middle school was one of the saddest moments of my life. One of my best friends was zoned to go to Klein Intermediate instead of Wunderlich :(
            Fortunately, I made some new friends at Wunderlich. Most of my current friends were made during middle school. After Wunderlich, I went to Klein Forest where one of my best friends left
            and another came back. I guess it's going okay.</p>
        <p>Some of the clubs/activities I have been in are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mu Alpha Theta</li>
            <li>Orchestra</li>
            <li>Stuco</li>
            <li>Interact</li>
        </ul>
        <hr><h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>In my free time, I like to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>lay in my bed</li>
            <li>draw</li>
            <li>lay on the couch</li>
        </ol>
        <hr><h1>Family</h1>
        <b>My mom:</b>
        <p>My mom's name is Leslie.She is 49 years old and works at the bank.</p>
        <b>My dad:</b>
        <p>My dad's name is James. He is turning 53 this year. His job is to check computers.</p>
        <b>My brother:</b>
        <p>My brother's name is Dylan. He is 21 years old, and doesn't have a job right now(as far as I know). He attends UT.</p>
        <hr><h1>Future</h1>
        I think I will go to UT after highschool and major in computer science. If I fail, I'll probably go a business route. Maybe math. I'm not really sure. 
        I'd prefer a job that let's me work from home.
